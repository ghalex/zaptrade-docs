### What is ZapCli

**ZapCli** is an open-source automation trading engine. That main focus is to simplify the process of **writing trading automations**.

It provides essential data and core functions, enabling you to concentrate on developing reusable trading strategies, indicators, and analyzers, rather than spending time on building infrastructure.

**ZapCli** supports writing trading automations in:

* [**Zplang**](https://zplang.com), an open-source programming language inspired by Clojure, designed for easy creation of trading automations
* **JavaScript** the most popular programming language in the world

**ZapCli** is the engine that drives the bots trading platform at [zapant.com](https://zapant.com)
