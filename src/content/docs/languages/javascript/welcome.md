### JavaScript support

With the addition of JavaScript support, you can now efficiently write scripts to automate and backtest your trading algorithms within our CLI. The integration of JavaScript brings several benefits:

- **Familiar Syntax**: If you already know JavaScript, you can quickly start writing and testing trading strategies.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Leverage JavaScript to handle complex trading logic, execute trades, analyze market data, and manage risk effectively.
- **Versatility**: Use JavaScript to communicate with web servers asynchronously, making it easier to fetch and process real-time market data.
